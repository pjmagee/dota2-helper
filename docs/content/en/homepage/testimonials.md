> Before the DOTA 2 Helper app, my pulls were like my predictions: completely off-timing. But now? The app screams at me, ‘HEY! STACK NOW!’—and I actually listen. My carry still dies under the tower, but at least I’m feeding the jungle creeps instead of the enemy team.

> My team hates me for taking jungle as Enigma, but thanks to the tiered neutral timers, I can plan my farm so well that I have a Midas and a Black Hole by 15 minutes. The sound alerts even remind me to fake-pretend I’m warding while stealing bounty runes. If they want me to stack, they can wait until my items are done.

— **AntiSupport42**, 2K MMR

> I used to pull camps… randomly. Sometimes I’d even stack the enemy jungle by accident. But DOTA 2 Helper gave me structure in my life. Now I get a soothing ding in my ear when it’s time to pull. Do I still ruin creep equilibrium? Of course! But at least I’m doing it on time now.

> I always get flamed for taking Techies offlane, but thanks to DOTA 2 Helper’s sound alerts, I know exactly when to stack camps for… well, myself

— **NeverStopMissing**, 4.5K MMR
