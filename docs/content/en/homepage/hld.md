From a technical standpoint, the DOTA 2 Helper app is a simple app that utilises a small amount of web technology and a bit of GSI to provide a few key features.

The underlying technology is .NET with Avalonia UI and a few other open source libraries.

The diagram below shows the high level design of the app.
